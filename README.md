# Battleship game
  
This is my final project of [Harvard's "CS50 Intrduction to Computer Science"](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) course (2022 edition). It's a browser version of a popular board game - [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

### Rules
This is a two-players game. Players make their moves in turns. Each has a 10x10 grid with ships placed on randomly (in traditional game you place them yourself, in this one they are placed for you).  
On your turn, you pick a cell on your opponent's ocean grid. If you call out a shot location that is occupied by a ship, it's a hit! If you call out a shot location not occupied by a ship, it's a miss. After a hit or a miss, your turn is over.  
Play continues in this manner, with you and your opponent calling one shot per turn.  
If you're the first player to sink your opponent's entire fleet, you win the game!  

In this version of battleship there are 4 types of ships:
- carrier of size 5
- battleships of size 4
- destroyer of size 3
- patrol boat of size 2  

Before starting the game you can choose how many ships will be on each ocean grid.
